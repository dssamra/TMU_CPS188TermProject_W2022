# TMU_CPS188TermProject_W2022
My CPS188 Term project for my Winter 2022 semester
The purpose of this project was to read a file containing the recorded temperatures of the Great Lakes for every day of the year.
We then use this information and store it into a matrix where we can read and analyze data to find information such as the hottest recorded temperature of each lake, the average temperature of each lake, and the biggest temperature changes in each lake.
